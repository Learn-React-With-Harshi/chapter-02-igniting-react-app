# `Learn React With Harshi 👩🏻‍💻 Series`
   Documenting my learning journey of [Namaste React Live Course](https://learn.namastedev.com/) conducted by Akshay Saini


`Chapter-02` was about creating production-ready react app from scratch without using create-react-app. The concept of bundlers (Parcel) was explained in detail. We all think React makes the application faster, though it is partially right, the major credit goes to the other packages/helper utilities (Bundler) for speeding up the application, optimizing the proformace and lots more. Find the detailed explanation in class notes. 

One line about this chapter : As Akshay says `Parcel` is a `BEAST`.
